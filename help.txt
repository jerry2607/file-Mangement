    -c <file_name> [permission]                         create the file with name (file_name) and permission (permission)
                                                        (default=776).
                                                        <file_name>:
                                                        if exists in current directory then it overwrite with retaining previous permissions.

                                                        Example : -c myfile.txt 656


    -r <file_name> [amount_of_bytes] [offset]           read the file (file_name).

                                                        <file_name>:

                                                        should be a integer.
                                                        It read the total character upto amount_of_bytes.
                                                        If it reach end of file it print and exit.

                                                        [offset] :

                                                        takes the file_pointer to the the offset .
                                                        if offset > no_character_in_file then it take it to the end_of_file;
    
    
    -w <file_name> [offset]                             write in file (file_name) and start OVERWRITE at [offset position] (default=0).

                                                        <file_name>:
                                                        exists in current directory then it can write.
                                                        not exists in current directory then it'll create one

                                                        takes the file_pointer to the the offset .

    -s <file_name>                                      show the information about file (file_name).

    -a <file_name>                                      append the content in file (file_name).


    -cp <file_name1> <file_name2>                       It copy the content of file_name1 to file_name2

                                                        <file_name1>

                                                        if file not exists then it will create one and then copy
